Defintions: Agent: Something that can take an action by its own. E.g. In an autonomous drone, agent would be drone itself would be agent. Similarly for an ML algorithm the Algo itself is an Agent.<br>
Enviornment: Place where agent takes action and operates is called as enviornment<br>
Actions (a(t)): All possible moves that an agent can perform in the given enviornment is called as actions. E.g. In the 2D space an agent can move right, left up or down and these represents all the action that agent can take.<br>
Observations: How enviornment interacts back with the agent after the actions are performed.<br>
Single State(s(t+1)): The immediate situation in which agent finds itself is defined as single state. <br>
Reward: Feedback of an action performed which is either a sucess or failure. It can be immediate e.g. While playing Mario once you touch the gold coin the points immediately incerases or it can be delayed as well e.g.
Picking up right set of stocks today will result in profits when markets go up. <br>
Reward Return = $'â¨Šri(i=1 to inf)`$<br>.
It represents the sum of reward at all times <br>
